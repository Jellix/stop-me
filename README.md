Based on a software implementation of an Adaptive Digital Element (ADDiE) this project provides a utility for continuously measuring performance data and generating images out of it. Mainly targeted at FPC, it should be useable with Delphi, too.

Uses [AggPas](http://www.crossgl.com/aggpas/) to create PNG images.
